<p>This is a game I made with a fellow college student for Brackeys Game Jam.</p>
<p>You play as robot who has to fight off other robots in a chaotic hellstorm.</p>
<p>Pick up abilities that spawn around the map, but be careful as these abilities can be</p>
<p>positive or negative for you or the enemies.</p>

### Manic Mansion
